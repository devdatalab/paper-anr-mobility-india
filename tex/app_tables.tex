  \input{\mobilitypath/app_table_validate_eds}

    \footnotesize{Table~\ref{tab:validate_eds} shows measures of
      internal consistency when there are multiple reports of an
      individual's father in the IHDS. We calculate the difference between a person's report of their parent's education and the parent's own reporting of it when in the same household. We then regress this difference on a constant (which provides the average difference, in Columns 1, 3, and 5), and on a series of household characteristics (Columns 2, 4, and 6).

  \footnotesize{Table~\ref{tab:bottom_half_stats} shows summary statistics describing individuals from the bottom and top half of the education distribution, respectively. The individual statistics describe men born in 1983--92, and in 1953--62. The household statistics describe the households where those men reside. Standard deviations are in parentheses.}

  and subgroup bottom half mobility when calculated using IHDS
  data downcoded to match standard education categories (Panel A, identical to Table~\ref{tab:mob_changes}) and using IHDS data with
  unadjusted granular years of education (Panel B). The results are similar because there are few individuals with education levels which were both in the bottom 50\% and needed to be downcoded.}

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{Relationship Between Fertility and Subgroup Upward Mobility}
  \label{tab:mech_fert}
  \input{\mobilitypath/mech_fertility}
  
  \footnotesize{Table~\ref{tab:mech_fert} shows estimates from
    regressions of child education rank on social group indicators and
    an individual's number of siblings, a proxy for mother's
    fertility. The sample is limited to individuals born in 1985--89
    to fathers with two or fewer years of education. The outcome
    variable thus corresponds to $\mu_0^{51}$, a close analog of
    bottom half mobility ($\mu_0^{50}$). Column 1 shows the estimation
    without the fertility measure for the full sample. Column 2 limits
    the data to the set of individuals for whom mother's fertility can
    be measured, and Column 3 adds the fertility variable. The effect
    of fertility on subgroup mobility gaps is understood as the change
    in the subgroup coefficient from Column 2 to Column 3. All
    regressions control for state fixed effects. Source: IHDS (2012).}
