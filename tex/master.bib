                  control variable forces a negative effect of oil on institutions. Show this by predicting each countries GDP in the absence of oil, based on region fixed effects and latitude. Neat idea, not sure if it's something we could do in India,

                  hazard), quality of candidate pool declines (adverse selection), interaction means incumbent can grab more rents when running against a weaker candidate pool (I don't buy this, since there's no reason that the guys who were going to run
                  before would fail to run now). They interpret an increase in probability of reelection as an outcome of a weaker candidate pool rather than because they have more money to spread around. -this paper has all of the citations that we would
                  want for our mining on politics paper
                  
                  New Thoughts on This Paper -incumbency effect is through imperfect information channel, same as cole rainfall paper -alternative ideas: voters want incumbent powerfull enough to combat mining companies, get concessions out of them, etc
                  -theoretically the selection effect on quality could go either way, depending on who is best able to benefit from the rents of a resource boom -we need to think about natural resource specific issues beyond the scope of this paper.
                  biggest difference is that our paper is about resource booms, not about government revenues. it shares the feature that we think rents go up when value of mineral deposits goes up. but there are other issues too: infrastructure needs to
                  be invested in, permits secured, etc. -to investigate: do certain features of our politicians (or of the locations) predict the increase in criminality/assets that we see. is it the less educated guys? those in politically more
                  competitive areas? that has nice predictions: if it's about accusations, then it will be in politically more competitive areas. if about corruption, in less competitive areas. -need to download and read robinson, torvik, verdier (2006)},

  annote        = {Duflo and Pande (2007) use gradient as an instrument for the decision to build a dam in a location in order to estimate the impact of damns lon local outcomes. They find that downstream areas benefit from the dam but districts in which
                  dams are built experience increases in poverty and the volatility of agricultrual production. They suggest that this reveals that markets and the state fail to address distributional consequencers of dam construction.
                  
                  -probably closest paper to what we're trying to do -data of interest: district-level annual agricultural data, district-level annual poverty data, -we need to figure out what goes into the decision of where to construct a mine -Evenson
                  {\&} McKinsey 1999 estimate agricultural production function in India -additional specifications that we can learn from: showing a trend break when dam is built (we might be able to do that with either annual district data, using
                  1990-1998 as the trend or by showing that the longer the mine has been in operation, the more of an effect there is), control for tribal and poverty share -results: downstream districts increase in irrigation and water intensive crops
                  -lots of robustness checks worth going back go: checking to see if changes preceded dam construction, -look at dams' effect on impact of rainfall, and just say that more rainfall is good since drought is the main problem (footnote 24)
                  -limited impact of economic shocks on migration (Topolova 2004) -using poverty to estimate welfare (we can't do that): poverty increases .77{\%} in response to a dam constructed -they worry a lot about time trends: we're going to get
                  grilled on that given our lack of data -they just go overboard with additional outcomes and checks. we should do the same: landlord institutions, tribal populations, malaria, public goods (banerjee and somanathan 2005)},

                  -basic finding: growth in rural industry happening most where lowest rates of yield increases are found, suggesting "rural industrialization and agricultural developent are substitutes" -D. Gale Johnson's work provides the starting point
                  for this question, which is ours exactly -Ravallion and Datt (1996,99) found no impact of ag on non-ag income, but it's at the state level and has shitty data -Foster Rosenzweig 2004 working paper shows that HYV yield growth raises
                  unskilled wages -this paper says that rainfall has no statistically significant effect on any of the dependent variables: presence of factory, nonfarm income or business income -data: panel on households in 240 villages in 15 states,
                  1971-99 -basic finding: industry grew in areas that experienced the least growth in crop yields -model predics this: increases in yield push up wages, making those areas less attractive for non-farm investments -interesting fact: yield
                  growth due to HYV occured in places that had lowest ago productivity to begin with in 1970 -their data suggests while non-farm income increased enormously to almost 50{\%} by 1999, it was all in the form of wages, not business income or
                  nonfarm enterprise. of course all of these people working for nonfarms were contributing to the growth of that sector, and it seems to be mostly manufacturing. but the point is that farmers themselves are not starting businesses. -their
                  data suggests village factory worker growth was huge, even bigger than NSS, from 5.7 workers in 82 to 57 in 99 (amazing!) -we need to look at post offices as well as banks, since they were a major form of saving for rural families
                  (apparently 90{\%} had them in 99, at least accorindg to this data) -nonfarm income grew fastest in places that experienced the least growth in yields (though these were also the places that started with the highest productivity in ag,
                  so not clear how to interpret) -enterprises: factories sprouted most in villages that experienced high yield growth -no support for "the hypothesis that growth in ag productivity releases capital that is then invested in the local
                  economy in the form of small business"},

                  Johnson 200, Lanjouw{\^{}}2 2001, HHR 2001 -here they are not testing whether ag is good or bad for non-ag growth, but whether ag or manufacturing is better for reducing income inequality -necessary to consider distinction between
                  tradeables and non-tradeables -do not find evience that local credit constraints or lack of investments in schools are barriers to non-ag income expansion

                  decision c capital imperfectably tradeable to allow factory location decision to depend on that as well. should work in a similar way to local demand, but we should model to see
                  
                  -three sectors: ag, non-tradeables services, factory goods (tradeables) -model 1: closed-economy: no capital, just ag and services, balanced growth. demand for services goes up as ag productivity increases, but labor is allocated
                  equally between sectors, so no movement in observed labor, just higher wages and prices. -model 2: capital mobility: increase in ag productivity results in higher wages and thus lower factory production.},

                  of cross country growth regressions -alternative approach is growth accounting and productivity measurement, but nothing much here -development accounting literature: factor accumulation or efficiency: ag is lower productivity in
                  developing countries, but not clear if this is because of lower factor (capital, human capital) accumulation -amazing! doesn't even mention HHR or Foster and Rosenzweig},

                  downward fluctuations in agriculture can generate perceptible downturns in rural nonfarm activity. Between 1978 and 1983, abnormal weather precipitated a 42 percent fall in agricultural income in the Bicol region of the Philippines and
                  an associated 49 percent fall in rural non- farm business incomes (Ranis, Stewart, and Angeles-Reyes 1990). Similarly, a devastating drought during the 1983–84 crop season in the North Arcot region of India triggered a 34 percent fall
                  in agricultural income, dragging in its wake a 24 percent fall in nonfarm earnings (Hazell and Ramasamy 1991). A series of West African case studies indicates that rainfall-induced reductions in year-to- year agricultural output lead to
                  a simultaneous falloff in rural nonfarm income during the affected year (Reardon 1997)."},

                  in 255 districts in 21 states on 13,000 mineral deposits -total value {\$}10 billion in 2000, of which 82{\%} was fuel -of the 9244 leases, 7{\%} to public sector -of 3100 mines, 566 fuel, 561 metallic, 1973 non-metallic. also total 828
                  in public sector, accounting for 84{\%} of value -mining provides between 2 and 2.5{\%} of GDP depending on the year -80{\%} of mines in seven states: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Karnataka -the
                  National Mineral Policy (1993) opened up sector to private investment (does not cover fuel minerals) -major PSU's were established 1956-73 for minerals (e.g. Hindustan Zinc, Steel Authority of India, etc) and most minerals reserved for
                  public sector -following minerals no longer reserved for PSU's: iron ore, manganese ore, sulphur, chomite, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and platinum group of minerals -Minor Minerals (granite, etc) are
                  administered by the state governments -Limestone goes into the production of many things, mostly cement (89{\%})
                  
                  GOVERNMENT and MINING -Federal: Ministrys: Coal {\&} Mines, Steel, Industry, MoEF, Labour. Mostly Mines and Coal -Gov gets money from mining from: royalty, dead rent, cess, sales tax, excise duties and custom duties -royalty and dead
                  rent: federal government sets rates but royalties and dead rents are paid to state governments, often fixed to international prices --these payments go to general pool, not to local areas, though there is a law being considered right now
                  to give 1/4 of royalties to local area -state regulations of dead rents vary considerably (not clear how this is consistent with federal government oversite of minerals...i'm guessing that this is just for minor minerals...see GOI
                  Royalties Report 2011 for more details) -Central Government levies taxes and duties (e.g. customs) on minerals (tis source of income) -Cess collected by Central government on some minerals (iron chief among them) to provite for social
                  services to workers and their families -state governments are in charge of prospecting licenses and mining leases, but environmental approval must be given by IBM -following minerals don't require any central government involvement:
                  apatite and rock phosphate, barytes, gypsum, vanadium, kyanite, magnesite, molybdenum, nickel, platinum and other precious metals, sillimanite, silver, sulphur, and its ores, tungsten and vanadium ores; while the following do require
                  federal government approval: asbestos, bauxite, zinc, chrome ore, precious stones, copper ore, manganese ore, gold lead, iron ore -ST's get preferential grant of mineral concessions in scheduled areas -state governments get to decide how
                  much should be paid by mining companies to land owners whose land is acquired -amendments to mining acts in 1999 and 2000 gave states more power to approve leases and mining plans in certain cases
                  
                  LIBERALIZATION -Mineral Policy 1993 allowed FDI subject to approval by FIBP -1997 reform opened up automatic approval for foreign equity up to 50{\%} in mines -2000: further liberalization to allow automatic approval of 100{\%} foreign
                  equity
                  
                  EXPORTS and IMPORTS -minerals and ores 17.6{\%} exports (but mostly reexporting diamonds) -21{\%} of all imports (again, diamonds big)},

                  {\textless}m:linebreak/{\textgreater}"There are two major crop growing season in India as for climate point of view. The summer or ‘kharif' crop growing season (June–September) coincides with southwest monsoon. The major ‘kharif'
                  crops are rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton, jute, groundnut, soybean and Bajra etc. Depending on crop duration, ‘kharif' crops can be harvested during the autumn (October–November) or winter (December– February) months. The southwest
                  monsoon is critical to the kharif crop, which accounts for more than 50{\%} of the food-grain production and 65{\%} of the oilseeds production in the country. Theinterannualmonsoonrainfallvariability in India leads to large-scale
                  droughts and floods, resulting in a major effect on Indian food grain production (Parthasarathy and Pant, 1985; Parthasarathy et al., 1992; Selvaraju, 2003;Kumar et al., 2004) and on the economy of the country (Gadgil et al., 1999a;
                  Kumar and Parikh, 2001). The winter or ‘rabi' crop-growing season starts after the summer monsoon, and continues through to the following spring or early summer. {\textless}m:underline{\textgreater}Rainfall occurring at the end of the

                  for both kharif and rabi crop production in India. The major ‘rabi' crops are wheat, mustard, Barley, potato, onion and gram etc."{\textless}m:linebreak/{\textgreater} {\textless}m:linebreak/{\textgreater}"Mall and Singh (2000)

  annote        = {Michaels: LT Consequences of Resource-Based Specialization -benefits: demand from workers, linkages with upstream and downstream industries -costs: dutch disease, volatility, corruption, pollution -economic geography: examples of
                  development due to natural resources (Ruhr valley, Krugman 1991 on the midwest) -subnational effects: positive in spain (Domenech 2008) and negative in US states (Papyrakis and Gerlagh 2007) -this paper uses variation in oil endowments
                  in southern counties to understand resource-based specialization
                  
                  FINDINGS: -baseline: places with and without oil pre-oil looked very similar in all kinds of dimensions -oil abundant counties had more manufacturing 1940-90, but they also had much more agricultural employment by 1990 -oil counties
                  gained big infrastructure: more likely to have highways and airports -no real effect of oil abundance on overall level of education, though multiple things are going on at once: supply, demand and migration -incomes higher and this
                  persists even in 1989 when oil prices low -inequality unaffected -land prices go up, offset increases in income -robustness: oil had no impact before oil was discovered, did after
                  
                  THOUGHTS: -differences at international and subnational level: exchange rates less relevant, conflict and state capture less relevant, migration has lower barriers internally -pop inflow may then lead to agglomeration forces: improved
                  matching, learning, sharing of indivible goods -if resources affect things at the state level, then you are not properly constructing your control group, so Michaels runs a specification where he compares resource counties in resource
                  states to non-resource counties in non-resource states -we need to worry that deposits were discovered in places that were booming
                  
                  OUTCOMES MEASURED: -fractions of mining, manufacturing and ag in total employment -population density
                  
                  ECONOMETRICS: -doesn't cluster standard errors in first set of regressions, does in second by country group -doesn't do state fixed effects in main regressions -only does intensity of oil as a robustness check, mostly is comparing oil to
                  non-oil. when he does, he basically gets same results: more employment in mining, more income, more population},

                  Editor:{\textless}m:linebreak/{\textgreater}Reject. I do not consider this paper to be a meaningful contribution to the field of economic development. The central issues are certainly important ones. Child malnutrition is a massive and
                  challenging problem in developing countries. Further, learning spillovers in public health is a new and growing research agenda. Yet this paper's flaws in both methodology and findings mean that one cannot say exactly what it is
                  contributing to either topic. The lack of randomization and small sample size mean that the lack of results in the ultimate outcome--child nutritional status--are very hard to interpret. We cannot claim to better understand how to combat
                  child malnutrition as the result of this paper. Further, the learning spillovers that are detected are self-reported and only appear in a minority of measures of the spillovers, further reducing confidence in the results. The model does
                  not improve the paper, as it does not closely match the treatment.{\textless}/m:note{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We study the impact of caste-based ethnic parties on the redistribution of public resources to historically disadvantaged low caste and indigenous communities in India. Exploiting the outcome of narrowly contested state assembly elections as a source of exogenous variation, we show that a 10 percentage point increase in legislators from low caste parties increases low caste households’ consumption from India’s largest safety net program by 4%. Further suggesting the importance of parties’ varying interests in redistribution to disadvantaged populations, we find that low caste representatives from major mainstream political parties have little effect on safety net access compared to such representatives from low caste parties. An analysis of mechanisms suggests that legislators from parties focused on low caste interests improve the overall targeting of safety net programs. The results highlight the important role played by political parties in facilitating minority representation within multi-ethnic democracies.}
